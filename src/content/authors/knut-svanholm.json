Currently, he spends his days hosting the Freedom Footprint Show and advising a handful of bitcoin companies and non-profit organizations. His writings are (generally) revered in the bitcoin space. Recently, he wrote a book about the science of human action, Praxeology. Occasionally, youâ€™ll find him entertaining people at conferences by speaking, playing guitar, moderating panels, or reciting inappropriate dad jokes to the wrong people.",
